The Story of Electrum
=====================

Electrum was created in 2011, in the midst of the largest ever online
Bitcoin wallet theft. Over 75,000 BTC had been stolen.

Dr. Thomas Voegtlin, a computer scientist at INRIA, set out to rectify
the situation.

Online services simply couldn't be trusted to hold Bitcoin reserves
unchecked. Bitcoin users deserved better.

Thomas began working on a special kind of Bitcoin wallet. Electrum had
to be so good that Bitcoin users would actually prefer it to traditional
Websites on the open market.

First, Electrum would have to run everywhere there was a Web browser.

Second, Electrum would have to start instantly.

Third, Electrum would have to be forgiving of mistakes.

Last but not least, Electrum would need to accomplish all this without
the need for trusted third parties.

Since 2011, Electrum has seen thousands of hours of development time
thanks to dozens of the most prolific Bitcoin developers around. It
has become a popular and widely proven Bitcoin wallet with tens of
thousands of satisfied users, who range from Bitcoin novices to core
Bitcoin developers.

To this day, Electrum remains simple and easy to use. No extra gadgetry
is required. It runs everywhere and it's Python extensible. No Internet
connection is needed. You shouldn't have to trust anyone else with your
money.
