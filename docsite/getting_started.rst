Getting Started
===============

Before we dive into the really fun parts -- playbooks, configuration
management, deployment, and orchestration, we'll learn how to get
Ansible installed and some basic concepts.  We'll go over how to execute
ad-hoc commands in parallel across your nodes using /usr/bin/ansible.
We'll also see what sort of modules are available in Ansible's core
(though you can also write your own, which we'll also show later).
